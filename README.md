# Robot Soccer
 
This program uses the Robot Operating System to direct a Turtlebot to drive into a blue ball, and take a soccer shot through a pair of colored cones (see scripts/task2.py). The bot first searches to identify locations for the ball and goal. Then it does some geometry to figure out the best angle to shoot from. It will position itself to take a shot, then it will push the ball through the goal. 

Bankshot.py does something similar, but in this case the ball will be placed beside (not in front of) the goal and near a wall. The program will find an angle to instead bounce the ball off of the wall so that it banks through the goal. 

See the project writeup for more details about how it works, and the videos folder to see it in action!
