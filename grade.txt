95/100
The report was good and detailed. I am very impressed at your bank shot -- clever idea with the wooden block. I do not have much feedback to give -- you only had one video of the robot getting the ball in the goal, so I can't tell how well it would work from other angles. But with the bank shot, it seems all your calculations worked fine.
